Standard deviation:
A measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.
A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set...
while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.
Reresented by the lower case Greek letter sigma Ïƒ for the population standard deviation or the Latin letter s for the sample standard deviation.

For example a normal distribution (or bell-shaped curve) where each band has a width of 1 standard deviation.

Gaussian distribution, another term for normal distribution.
Uniform distribution, sometimes also known as a rectangular distribution, is a distribution that has constant probability.
Exponential distribution, looks like an arc when graphed.
