# Create an application that simulates a load balancer and 
# is able to distribute the requests between 2 or more backend services.
# Assume the most basic balancer algorithm: round robin.

# Extras:
# * Dynamic. The configuration is not hardcoded, it might be changed
# without modifying the actual application code, thus including a config
# file with any well-known markup language like yaml is a plus.
# * Healthcheck. The ability to take off/on or serve the response
# if any of the backend services is alive.
# * Sorry page. If no backends are available avoid sending a "service
# unavailable (503)" response.

"""
This simulates a load balancer that distributes requests between multiple virtual machines.

To start this Flask application:
FLASK_APP=load_balancer.py flask run

To get the content from the fake VMs, use curl or a browser:
curl 127.0.0.1:5000
